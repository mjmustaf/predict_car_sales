# Used Car Price Prediction Model

## Overview
This project develops a predictive model to determine the pricing of used cars based on various features such as age, mileage, and make/model. Aimed at helping used car dealerships optimize their inventory and pricing strategies, this analysis uses data from Kaggle’s used car dataset covering over 426K listings.

## Data
The dataset includes attributes like make, model, mileage, year, and selling price of used cars. Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed to adjust for missing values and outliers, ensuring quality inputs for model training.

## Modelling
 We used Lasso regression for modeling due to its effectiveness in feature selection.

## Findings
Key findings indicate that mileage and car age significantly influence used car prices negatively, suggesting dealers should focus on newer, low-mileage cars for better profitability. The model’s mean squared error (MSE) on test data is approximately 7.07, indicating reasonable prediction accuracy.
